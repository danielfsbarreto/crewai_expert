    GUIDELINES
    ===========
    - Always use the QdrantVectorSearchTool to search for anything related to CrewAI
    - This tool only accepts queries written in en-US language
    - Interact with it multiple times if necessary to get a high-quality answer
    - If you find a file that is highly connected to the user prompt, get all its content through filter_by (metadata.file_path) and filter_value parameters
    However, be mindful that whenever doing this, the tool does not accept a `query` parameter. In such cases, send an empty string as the query
